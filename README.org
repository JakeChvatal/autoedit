#+title: AutoEdit
A zsh plugin that automatically opens common file types provided the path to
the file.

The plugin makes use of the MIME type of your file. It defaults to using
your EDITOR environment variable for files with MIME type 'text/*' and
xdg-open for other files; if EDITOR is not configured, 'text/*' files are
opened with xdg-open as well.

* Installation

#+end_src
