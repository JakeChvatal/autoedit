#+title: AutoEdit
A zsh plugin that automatically opens common file types.
Provide the path to the file, press enter, and the file will be opened in your editor.

The plugin makes use of the MIME type of your file. It defaults to using
your EDITOR environment variable for files with MIME type 'text/*' and
xdg-open for other files; if EDITOR is not configured, 'text/*' files are
opened with xdg-open as well.

* Installation
Provide your zsh package manager a path to this repository.

Example for antigen:
#+begin_src zsh
antigen bundle 'jakechvatal/autoedit'
#+end_src
